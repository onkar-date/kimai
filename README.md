## Kimai Bulk Submit Helper

This repository contains the Kimai Bulk Submit Helper – a small web application that sits on top of Technogise's Kimai instance and makes bulk timesheet entry and submission easier.

### Repository Structure

- .github/ – System-design docs, coding guidelines and implementation plans.
- frontend/ – Vite + React (JavaScript) single-page application (SPA) for the helper UI.

### Frontend (Vite + React SPA)

The frontend implementation lives under the `frontend/` directory and is a Vite-powered React SPA.

Once dependencies are installed, you can run:

- `npm install` (from the `frontend/` directory) – install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` – start the development server.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist/`.

### System-Design Documentation

The detailed system-design documents for the Kimai Bulk Submit Helper are available under:

- .github/stories-and-plans/system-designs/kimai-bulk-submit-helper/

These describe the problem, requirements, architecture, components, data model and roadmap for the helper.
